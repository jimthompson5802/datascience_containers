# Configuration For AWS

## FoxyProxy Config File 
Required to support dynamic port forwarding to AWS.  This allows browser accessing containers through the ec2 instance public internet interface.  Currently working with Chrome Browser.

Use of FoxyProxy is modelled after [AWS's use of FoxyProxy to support access to EMR clusters](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/ManagementGuide/emr-connect-master-node-proxy.html).
